# LLD Prereq

| Principle | Full Form                | Meaning                                                      | Benefit                            |
| --------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| DRY       | Don’t Repeat Yourself    | Avoid duplicating logic/code; extract into functions/classes | Easy to maintain, clean code       |
| YAGNI     | You Aren’t Gonna Need It | Don’t build features until needed                            | Prevents overengineering           |
| KISS      | Keep It Simple, Stupid   | Simplicity > cleverness; readable code wins                  | Easier debugging and scaling       |
| SRP       | Single Responsibility    | Each class/module does one thing only                        | Easier to refactor and test        |
| OCP       | Open/Closed              | Extend behavior without changing existing code               | Stable code, easier upgrades       |
| LSP       | Liskov Substitution      | Subtypes must be usable in place of base types               | Avoids unexpected failures         |
| ISP       | Interface Segregation    | Favor small, focused interfaces                              | Cleaner design, fewer side effects |
| DIP       | Dependency Inversion     | High-level code depends on interfaces, not concrete classes  | More flexible and testable code    |
